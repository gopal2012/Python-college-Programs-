# Write a Python program to concatenate two strings and calculate their combined length.


# Concatenating two strings
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"

# Concatenation
result = str1 + " " + str2

# Calculating length
length = len(result)

print("Concatenated string:", result)
print("Length of the concatenated string:", length)
