# Write a Python program that compares two numbers using comparison operators and prints the results.

# Demonstrating comparison operators
a = 10
b = 20

print("a == b:", a == b)  # Equal
print("a != b:", a != b)  # Not equal
print("a > b:", a > b)    # Greater than
print("a < b:", a < b)    # Less than
print("a >= b:", a >= b)  # Greater than or equal to
print("a <= b:", a <= b)  # Less than or equal to
